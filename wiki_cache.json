      "summary": "A creeper is a common hostile mob that quietly approaches a player, hisses, and if not retreated from in time, will explode. Creeper explosions can destroy blocks and deal massive amounts of damage, which can be completely blocked using a shield.\n\nWhen struck by lightning, a creeper becomes a charged creeper, which amplifies its explosion power and enables mob heads to be obtained from piglins, zombies, skeletons and other creepers it kills.\n\nDue to its distinctive appearance and unique destructive method of attack, the creeper has become one of the most iconic mobs of Minecraft, being featured in promotional material and merchandise.",
